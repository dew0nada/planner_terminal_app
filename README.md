# Planner Terminal App

A simple terminal-based planner built in **C** — my first project!  
It manages tasks directly from the command line and stores them in a text file.

## Features
- Add, view, and delete tasks
- Save all data for later use
- Simple command-line interface
- Create and manage sessions in custom categories (like Uni or Home)
- Sort sessions by time or priority
- Search, edit, or delete sessions by name or date

## 🧠 What I learned
- File handling in C  
- Working with structs and text files

## 🛠️ How to Run
```bash
gcc priject.c -o planner
./planner
